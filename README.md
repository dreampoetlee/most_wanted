## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to make at least 15 consistent commits with good, descriptive messages.

- As a developer, I want to run validation on any user input, ensuring that a user is re-prompted when they provide invalid input.

- TASK #4 -- As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on a single criterion
  · You should be able to find and return a list of people who match the search

- TASK #5 -- As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on multiple traits (up to a maximum of five criteria at once).
  · i.e., if you search for Gender: male and Eye Color: blue, you should get back a list of people who match the search. In this case, it will be only people who are male with blue eyes.

-- NOTE: Task items 4 and 5 help us narrow down the list to one person. Task items 1, 2, and 3 help us display information about them. --

- TASK #1 -- As a user, I want to be able to look up someone’s information after I find them with the program (display values for the various traits of the found person).

- TASK #2 -- As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s immediate family members, displaying the names of the family members and their relation to the found person.
  · i.e., spouse, parents, siblings

- TASK #3 -- As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants (display the names of the descendants).

## Bonus

- As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants (display the names of the descendants), using recursion.
